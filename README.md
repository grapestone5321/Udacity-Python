# Introduction to Python Programming




## LESSON 1
Welcome to Introduction to Python Programming

Welcome to Introduction to Python!


## LESSON 2
[NEW] Why Python Programming

Welcome to Introduction to Python! Here's an overview of the course.


## LESSON 3
[NEW] Data Types and Operators

Familiarize yourself with the building blocks of Python! Learn about data types and operators, compound data structures, type conversion, built-in functions, and style guidelines.


## LESSON 4
[NEW] Data Structures

Use data structures to order and group different data types together! Learn about the types of data structures in Python, along with more useful built-in functions and operators.


## LESSON 5
[NEW] Control Flow

Build logic into your code with control flow tools! Learn about conditional statements, repeating code with loops and useful built-in functions, and list comprehensions.


## LESSON 6
[NEW] Functions

Learn how to use functions to improve and reuse your code! Learn about functions, variable scope, documentation, lambda expressions, iterators, and generators.


## LESSON 7
[NEW] Scripting

Setup your own programming environment to write and run Python scripts locally! Learn good scripting practices, interact with different inputs, and discover awesome tools.


## LESSON 8
[NEW] Advanced Topics

In this lesson we cover some advanced topics of iterators and generators. You are not required to complete this but we have provided these to give you a taste of these.


## LESSON 9
Numbers and Strings

In this lesson you will learn how to use Python's numeric and string data types. You will use built-in functions and methods to process this data, and store the results in variables


## LESSON 10
Functions, Installation and Conditionals

In this lesson you will install Python on your own computer. You will learn how to define functions, and how to use conditional statements to write more elaborate programs. We will also practice our software engineering skills by learning how to break programs down into manageable pieces.


## LESSON 11
Data Structures and Loops

In this lesson you will learn how to use Python's collections: lists, sets and dictionaries. You will learn how to iterate over these collections with for loops and while loops. You will also learn how to build compound data structures that combine these collections. We will practice the software engineering skills of refactoring and self-reliant problem solving.


## LESSON 12
Files and Modules

In this lesson you will extend your knowledge of functions by learning how to specify default arguments and how to return multiple value from a function. You will learn how to read from files. You will also learn how to import modules from Python's standard library, and how to install third-party libraries. We will also learn more about reliant problem solving.


## LESSON 13
Wikipedia Web Crawl Case Study

In this lesson we will apply the skills learned previously by writing a web crawler that explores Wikipedia.
